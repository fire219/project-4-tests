               EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)

               A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.

               A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather 
               floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down 
               toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive 
               by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.

               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked 
               back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. 
               The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward 
               the street.

               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying 
               back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather 
               floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's 
               mudsoaked shoe.

               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is 
               FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a 
               box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.

               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a 
               pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.

               Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places 
               the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.

               Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all 
               there.

               Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.

               A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus 
               continues on.

               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at 
               the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a 
               magazine as Forrest looks at her.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.

               He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.

                                     FORREST
                         You want a chocolate?

               The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this 
               strange man next to her.

                                     FORREST
                         I could eat about a million and a 
                         half of these. My momma always said, 
                         "Life was like a box of chocolates.
                         You never know what you're gonna 
                         get."

               Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's 
               shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         Those must be comfortable shoes. 
                         I'll bet you could walk all day in 
                         shoes like that and not feel a thing. 
                         I wish I had shoes like that.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         My feet hurt.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma always says there's an awful 
                         lot you could tell about a person by 
                         their shoes. Where they're going.
                         Where they've been.

               The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his 
               own shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I 
                         think about it real hard I could 
                         remember my first pair of shoes.

               Forrest closes his eyes tightly.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said they'd take my anywhere.

               INT. COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY 
               (1951)

               A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as 
               he sits in a doctor's office.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said they was my magic shoes.

               Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg 
               braces.

                                     DOCTOR
                         All right, Forrest, you can open 
                         your eyes now. Let's take a little 
                         walk around.

               The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around 
               stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks 
               around the room awkwardly.

                                     DOCTOR
                         How do those feel? His legs are 
                         strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've 
                         ever seen. But his back is as crooked 
                         as a politician.

               Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.

                                     DOCTOR
                         But we're gonna straighten him right 
                         up now, won't we, Forrest?

               A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest!

               EXT. GREENBOW, ALABAMA

               Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest 
               walks stiffly next to his mother.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, when I was a baby, Momma named 
                         me after the great Civil War hero, 
                         General Nathan Bedford Forrest...

               EXT. RURAL ALABAMA

               A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

               The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded 
               sheet over his head.

               The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.

               The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan 
               members dressed in full uniform.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said we was related to him in 
                         some way. And, what he did was, he 
                         started up this club called the Ku 
                         Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in 
                         their robes and their bedsheets and 
                         act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks 
                         or something. They'd even put 
                         bedsheets on their horses and ride 
                         around. And anyway, that's how I got 
                         my name. Forrest Gump.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma said that the Forrest part was 
                         to remind me that sometimes we all 
                         do things that, well, just don't 
                         make no sense.

               Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's 
               brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and 
               tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a 
               barber shop and watch.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Just wait, let me get it.

               Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Let me get it. Wait, get it this 
                         way. Hold on.

               Forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right.

               Mrs. Gump helps Forrest up onto the sidewalk. She looks up 
               and notices the two old man.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Oooh. All right. What are you all 
                         staring at? Haven't you ever seen a 
                         little boy with braces on his legs 
                         before?

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two 
               old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Don't ever let anybody tell you 
                         they're better than you, Forrest. If 
                         God intended everybody to be the 
                         same, he'd have given us all braces 
                         on our legs.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always had a way of explaining 
                         things so I could understand them.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY/THE GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road. A row of 
               mailboxes stands left.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We lived about a quarter mile of 
                         Route 17, about a half mile from the 
                         town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in 
                         the county of Greenbow. Our house 
                         had been in Momma's family since her 
                         grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come 
                         across the ocean about a thousand 
                         years ago. Something like that.

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House 
               driveway.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Since it was just me and Momma and 
                         we had all these empty rooms, Momma 
                         decided to let those rooms out. Mostly 
                         to people passing through. Like from, 
                         oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like 
                         that. That's how me and Mommy got 
                         money. Mommy was a real smart lady.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Remember what I told you, Forrest.
                         You're no different than anybody 
                         else is.

               Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch. She bends down to look 
               Forrest in the eye.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
                         You're the same as everybody else. 
                         You are no different.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.
                         Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, we're all different, Mr.
                         Hancock.

               The principal sighs, then stands up.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She wanted me to have the finest 
                         education, so she took me to the 
                         Greenbow County Central School. I 
                         met the principal and all.

               The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump. Forrest, sitting 
               left, listens.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         I want to show you something, Mrs.
                         Gump. Now, this is normal.

               The principal holds up a chart with a designations according 
               to I.Q. and points to the center of the graph, labeled 
               "Normal." A red line below the normal area is labeled "State 
               Acceptance." The principal points to the section below the 
               acceptance line labeled "Below."

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Forrest is right here. The state 
                         requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to 
                         attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
                         He's gonna have to go to a special 
                         school. Now, he'll be just fine.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         What does normal mean, anyway? He 
                         might be a bit on the slow side, but 
                         my boy Forrest is going to get the 
                         same opportunities as everyone else.
                         He's not going to some special school 
                         to learn to how to re-tread tires. 
                         We're talking about five little points 
                         here. There must be something can be 
                         done.

                         We're a progressive school system.
                         We don't want to see anybody left

                         Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         He's on vacation.

               EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest sits on a swing outside the house. Loud organic male 
               grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits 
               on the swing as the grunts continue. The principal steps out 
               of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face.

               Forrest is sitting on the porch.

                         Well, your momma sure does care about 
                         your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.

               The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back 
               at Forrest.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         You don't say much, do you?

               Forrest grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed, 
               turns and walks away.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Mrs. Gump reads from the book "Curious George" as Forrest 
               sits on the bed and listens.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Finally, he had to try it. It looked 
                         easy, but, oh, what happened. First 
                         there...

                                     FORREST
                         Momma, what's vacation mean?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation?

                                     FORREST
                         Where Daddy went?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation's when you go somewhere, 
                         and you don't ever come back.

               Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Anyway, I guess you could say me and 
                         Momma was on our own.

               EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk 
               toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But we didn't mind. Our house was 
                         never empty. There was always folks 
                         comin' and goin'.

                                     MRS. GUMP (V.O.)
                         Suppa.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump steps forward and speaks to all the boarders.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...

               A MAN WITH A CANE steps left across the hall.

                                     MAN WITH CANE
                         My, my. That sure looks special.

               Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders 
               about dinner.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Gentlemen, would you care to join us 
                         for supper? Hurry up and get it before 
                         the flies do. I prefer you don't 
                         smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we had so many people 
                         stayin' with us that every room was 
                         filled with travelers. You know, 
                         folks livin' out of their suitcases, 
                         and hat cases, and sample cases.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, you go ahead and start. I can't 
                         find Forrest.

               Mrs. Gump walks up the stairs.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest... Forrest...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         One time a young man was staying 
                         with us, and he had him a guitar 
                         case.

               Mrs. Gump looks into Forrest's room. She hears singing coming 
               from another room and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump 
               opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as 
               he plays the guitar and sings. Forrest holds onto a broom 
               and dances oddly. The young man is ELVIS PRESLEY.

                                     ELVIS PRESLEY
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a 
                         rabbit, and you ain't no friend of 
                         mine."

               Forrest's legs rock back and forth to the guitar.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest! I told you not to bother 
                         this nice young man.

                                     ELVIS
                         Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I 
                         was just showin' him a thing or two 
                         on the guitar here.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right, but your supper's ready 
                         if y'all want to eat.

                                     ELVIS
                         Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, 
                         ma'am.

               Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door. Elvis sits back down.

               Forrest stands left, and looks himself in a mirror.

                                     ELVIS
                         Say, man, show me that crazy little 
                         walk you just did there. Slow it 
                         down some.

               Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays the guitar and 
               sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound 
                         dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I liked that guitar.

               Forrest dances as he watches himself in the mirror.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It sounded good.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "...cryin' all the time"

               Forrest rocks up and down on his braced legs, then begins to 
               step.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I started moving around to the music, 
                         swinging my hips. This one night me 
                         and Momma...

               EXT. GREENBOW - NIGHT

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk. A television 
               inside a store window reveals Elvis Presley as he performs 
               "Houng Dog" on a stage.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...was out shoppin', and we walked 
                         right by Benson's Furniture and 
                         Appliance store, and guess what.

               The television reveals Elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest watch the television. Elvis dances 
               around in the same manner Forrest did. A woman in the audience 
               screaming and applauding.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         This is not children's eyes.

               Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her. Forrest stops 
               and takes one last look. Elvis continues to perform over the 
               television.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit 
                         and you ain't no friend of mine."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some years later, that handsome young 
                         man who they called "The King," well, 
                         he sung too many songs, had himself 
                         a heart attack or something.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench. The black nurse 
               looks at him.

                                     FORREST
                         Must be hard being a king. You know, 
                         it's funny how you remember some 
                         things, but some things you can't.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/ALABAMA - MORNING (1954)

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus. The bus pulls 
               up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         You do your very best now, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         I sure will, Momma.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I remember the bus ride on the first 
                         day of school very well.

               The bus driver opens the door and looks down. Forrest walks 
               to the steps of the bus and looks at the bus driver. She is 
               smoking a cigarette.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         Are you comin' along?

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said not to be taking rides 
                         from strangers.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         This is the bus to school.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         I'm Dorothy Harris.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

               The bus driver smiles as Forrest steps up into the bus.

               INT. BUS

               Forrest steps up onto the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as 
               the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle.

               TWO YOUNG BOYS look up from the seat.

                                     BOY #1
                         This seat's taken.

                                     BOY #2
                         It's taken!

               Forrest looks around. A larger girl slides over so Forrest 
               can't sit next to her. She shakes her head. Forrest looks to 
               the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat. They 
               boy glares up at Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         You can't sit here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         You know, it's funny what a young 
                         man recollects. 'Cause I don't 
                         remember being born.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I, I... don't recall what I got for 
                         my first Christmas and I don't know 
                         when I went on my first outdoor 
                         picnic. But, I do remember the first 
                         time I heard the sweetiest voice...

               INT. BUS - MORNING (1954)

               Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...in the wide world.

                                     GIRL
                         You can sit here if you want.

               Forrest looks back at JENNY CURRAN, a young girl about 
               Forrest's age.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I had never seen anything so beautiful 
                         in my life. She was like an angel.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, are you gonna sit down, or 
                         aren't ya?

               Forrest sits down next to Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         What's wrong with your legs?

                                     FORREST
                         Um, nothing at all, thank you. My 
                         legs are just fine and dandy.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I just sat next to her on that bus 
                         and had conversation all the way to 
                         school.

                                     JENNY
                         Then why do you have those shoes on?

                                     FORREST
                         My momma said my back's crooked like 
                         a question mark. These are going to 
                         make me as straight as an arrow.
                         They're my magic shoes.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And next to Momma, no one ever talked 
                         to me or asked me questions.

                                     JENNY
                         Are you stupid or something.

                                     FORREST
                         Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.

               Jenny puts her hand out toward Forrest. Forrest reaches over 
               and shakes her hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         From that day on, we was always 
                         together. Jenny and me was like peas 
                         and carrots.

               EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

               Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She taught me how to climb...

               Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

               Forrest dangles from the branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...I showed her how to dangle.

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read.

                                     FORREST
                         "...a good little monkey and..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She helped me to learn how to read.

               Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and 
               forth. Forrest's braces are wedged in the tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And I showed her to swing.

               EXT. OAK TREE - NIGHT

               The silhouete of the oak tree, Jenny and Forrest as they sit 
               on a branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait 
                         for the stars.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma's gonna worry about me.

               Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand.

                                     JENNY
                         Just stay a little longer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         For some reason, Jenny didn't never 
                         want to go home.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She was my most special friend.

               INT. SAVANNAH/BUS STOP - DAY

               Forrest nods as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         My only friend.

               Forrest continues talking to the black woman. She doesn't 
               seem to be listening as she reads her magazine. She looks up 
               from her magazine.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, my Momma always told me that 
                         miracles happen every day. Some people 
                         don't think so, but they do.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - ANOTHER DAY (1954)

               Jenny and Forrest walk. A dirt clod hits Forrest in the back 
               of the head. Jenny looks as Forrest rubs his head. THREE 
               YOUNG BOYS get off their bikes and pick up more rocks.

                                     BOY #1
                         Hey... dummy!

               Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod. Forrest 
               falls backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him.

                                     BOY #2
                         Are you retarded, or just plain 
                         stupid?

                                     BOY #3
                         Look, I'm Forrest Gump.

               Jenny helps Forrest back up. Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more 
               dirt clods at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Just run away, Forrest.

               Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the arm.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces makes it 
               impossible. He hobbles along as Jenny yells after him.

                                     JENNY
                         Run away! Hurry!

               Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes.

                                     BOY #2
                         Get the bikes!

                                     BOY #3
                         Hurry up!

               The boys pick up their bikes and ride after Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         Let's get him! Come on!

                                     BOY #2
                         Look out, dummy, here we come!

               The boys ride after Forrest. Jenny stands and watches.

                                     BOY #2
                         We're gonna get you!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               Forrest hobbles along the dirt road.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest looks over his shoulder. The three boys race on their 
               bikes.

                                     BOY #1
                         Come back here, you!

               Forrest begins to run faster with his braces on. Forrest 
               continues running as the boys chase him. Blood drips down 
               from a cut on his head. The boys on the bikes are gaining on 
               Forrest. Forrest hobbles along. He begins to gain speed.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               SLOW MOTION --

               Forrest runs from the chasing room. He looks over his shoulder 
               in fear.

               The boys on the bikes peddle faster as they gain on Forrest, 
               running.

               Forrest tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly his 
               braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the 
               air.

               Forrest runs and look down at his legs in surprise.

               Forrest continues to run faster as the metal braces and straps 
               fly off his legs.

               Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed.

               The chasing boys ride over the remains of Forrest's braces.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, you wouldn't believe it if I 
                         told you.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/ BUS BENCH - DAY

                                     FORREST
                         But I can run like the wind blows.

               The black woman continues to read her magazine. Forrest smiles 
               as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         From that day on, if I was going 
                         somewhere, I was running!

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - DAY (1954)

               Forrest sprints away from the boys. The boys stop the chase 
               and watch in disbelief. Forrest is already at the far end of 
               the road, clear of the chasing boys.

                                     BOY #2
                         He's gettin' away! Stop him!

               Boy #1 throws his bike down in frustration. Forrest runs 
               across a field.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD

               Forrest runs past a chain gang in their prison uniforms.

               They are cutting at the weeds on the side of the road.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Forrest runs across the street. THE TWO OLD MEN sit in front 
               of the barber shop.

                                     OLD CRONY
                         That boy sure is a running fool.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE

               Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now remember how I told you that 
                         Jenny never seemed to want to go 
                         home? Well, she lived in a house 
                         that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma 
                         had gone up to heaven when she was 
                         five and her daddy was some kind of 
                         a farmer.

               Forrest knocks on Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny? Jenny?

               Forrest look around the field at the left. He notices Jenny 
               and runs toward her.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He was a very lovin' man. He was 
                         always kissing and touchin' her and 
                         her sisters. And then this one time, 
                         Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to 
                         school.

               Forrest runs to Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny, why didn't you come to school 
                         today?

                                     JENNY
                         Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.

               Jenny grabs Forrest's hand and runs into the field. Jenny's 
               DAD drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Come on!

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd 
                         better come back here, girl!

               Jenny's dad steps out toward the field. Jenny leads Forrest 
               into the thick tobacco field. Jenny's dad runs through the 
               field searching for Jenny with a liquor bottle in his hand.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Where you at?

               Jenny and Forrest run into a corn field as Jenny's dad tries 
               to chase her.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!

               Jenny drops to her knees and pulls Forrest down with her.

                                     JENNY
                         Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always said that God is 
                         mysterious.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Get back here!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He didn't turn Jenny into a bird 
                         that day. Instead...

               EXT. TRAILER PARK/ALABAMA - DAY (1955)

               A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer.

               Jenny's grandmother meets Jenny outside and leads her toward 
               the trailer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...he had the police say Jenny didn't 
                         have to stay in that house no more.
                         She went to live with her grandma 
                         just over on Creekmore Avenue, which 
                         made me happy 'cause she was so close.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT (1955)

               Jenny climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and 
                         come over to my house, just 'cause 
                         she said she was scared. Scared of 
                         what, I don't know...

               INT. GUMP HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Jenny lies in bed next to young Forrest. She hugs him.

                         and me was best friends...

               EXT. GREENBOW/OAK ALLEY - DAY (1961)

               Forrest and Jenny are teenagers now. They walk along an 
               oaklined road.

                         ...all the way to high school.

               Suddenly Forrest is hit in the back with a rock. Forrest and 
               Jenny turn around.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Hey, stupid!

                                     JENNY
                         Quit it!

               A teenage boy throws another rock as a pickup truck pulls up 
               behind him. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest, run!

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage 
               boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy 
               as the truck speeds after Forrest. Jenny steps left and gets 
               out of the way.

                                     OLDER BOY #2
                         Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

                         You better be runnin', stupid.

               Forrest runs along the road. The truck speeds after him.

                                     OLDER BOY #2
                         Come on, dummy!

               Older Boy throws rocks at Forrest.

                                     OLDER BOY #1

               EXT. OAK ALLEY

               The boys in the back of the truck throw rocks at Forrest as 
               they drive up to him.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Move it, jack rabbit!

               The truck follows right on Forrest's heels. A rebel flag 
               license plate adorns the truck's grill.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Come on!

               Forrest runs along the road as the truck chases him. The 
               boys in the back of the truck pound on the roof as the truck 
               turns right, after Forrest. The truck drives into a field.

               Forrest runs toward a fence.

                                     BOY
                         Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on, 
                         Forrest! Yeah!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch 
               him.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest looks left as he continues telling his life story.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, it used to be, I ran to get 
                         where I was goin'. I never thought 
                         it would take me anywhere.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/ROAD - DAY (1961)

               Forrest runs along the road in front of the high school. The 
               truck continues to chase him as the boys pound on the roof.

                                     OLDER BOY
                         Come on. Whoo-hoo!

               The truck speeds past Forrest as he turns from the road and 
               runs onto the high school football field. Forrest runs across 
               the field during a football scrimmage.

               In the stands watching the scrimmage is the legendary 
               University of Alabama football coach BEAR BRYANT, wearing 
               his trademark plaid hat.

               A group of assistant coaches sit around him, as well as the 
               high school football coach. The quarterback throws the ball 
               into the air.

               Forrest runs past the quarterback. The receiver catches the 
               ball. Forrest runs past the receiver as an opposing player 
               tackles the stunned receiver.

               The football coach stands, followed by the assistant coaches.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Who in the hell is that?

                         That there is Forrest Gump. Coach.
                         Just a local idiot.

               Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end 
               zone.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And can you believe it? I got to go 
                         to college, too.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA STADIUM - DAY (1962)

               The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off.

               The football players run around on the field. The crowd of 
               cheering fans create a huge sign that reads: "GO."

               Forrest is in a University of Alabama football uniform. He 
               looks up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the 
               kickoff. The teammate runs over to Forrest and hands him the 
               ball.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Okay! Run!

               The football coach, the assistants, and Alabama players cheer 
               for Forrest.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!

               Forrest runs across the field. He speeds past the defending 
               players. Forrest runs past the opposite players. The crowd 
               cheers wildly, holding up cards, making a large sign that 
               reads: "Go."

               They turn the cards over, creating the word: "ALABAMA." The 
               football coach runs along the sidelines as he yells.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!
                         Run!

               Forrest cuts and runs toward the sidelines. Two opposing 
               players collide. The football coach, the assistants and the 
               players all motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run! Turn! Go!

               Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.

               Some opposing players fall down. Forrest runs along the 
               sidelines. The opposing players try to catch him.

               Forrest runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives 
               at his feet. The referee holds up his arm, signaling a touch 
               down. The crowd cheers wildly.

               Forrest continues to run, smashing through the band members, 
               then all the way toward the team tunnel. The football coach 
               looks at an assistant coach.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         He must be the stupidest son-of-a-
                         bitch alive. But he sure is fast!

                         Now, maybe it was just me but college 
                         was very confusing times.

                         We must have no violence today, or 
                         any other day, because these National 
                         Guardsmen are here today as Federal 
                         Soldiers for Alabamans. And they 
                         live within our borders and they are 
                         all our brothers. We are winning in

                         that we have spoken about so many 
                         times, just so evident today, the 
                         trend toward military dictatorship 
                         in this country.

               Some of the Alabama policeman and citizens clap their hands 
               as the National Guardsmen stand at attention with their 
               weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd.

               Two black students were being led toward the schoolhouse.

                         desegregated and students Jimmy Hood 
                         and Vivian Malone had been signed up 
                         for summer classes.

               The young black girl drops one of her books. Forrest notices 
               and steps past the policeman toward the book on the ground.

               Forrest steps out from the crowd and picks up the book. He 
               brings it up to the girl.

                         campus, he kept the mob from gathering 
                         and prevented violence.

                                     ASSISTANT COACH
                         Naw, that couldn't be.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         It sure as hell was.

                         Now a word from Anacin.

               Forrest steps up to the coaches' area and grabs a clean towel.

               The coaches turn and stare at Forrest. Forrest gives them 
               one of his silly waves, then walks away.

               COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace waves to the crowd as he 
               stands behind a podium with his wife.

                         A few years later, that angry little 
                         man at the schoolhouse door thought 
                         it would be a good idea, and ran for 
                         President.

               COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace mingles in a crowd. Gunshots 
               are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter. Wallace 
               lies wounded on the ground.

                         But, somebody thought that it wasn't.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest sits on the bench as the black woman looks at him. A 
               WHITE WOMAN with a bay sits left.

                                     FORREST
                         But he didn't die.

               A bus pulls up to the bus stop. The BLACK WOMAN looks down 
               at her watch.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         My bus is here.

                                     FORREST
                         Is it the number 9?

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         No, it's the number 4.

               The Black Woman gets up and steps over to the bus.

                                     FORREST
                         It was nice talkin' to you.

               The white woman sits closer to Forrest.

                                     WHITE WOMAN
                         I remember when that happened, when 
                         Wallace got shot. I was in college.

                                     FORREST
                         Did you go to a girls' college, or 
                         to a girls' and boys' together 
                         college?

                                     WHITE WOMAN
                         It was co-ed.

                                     FORREST
                         'Cause Jenny went to a college I 
                         couldn't go to. It was a college 
                         just for girls.

               EXT, GIRLS' COLLEGE/JENNY'S DORM - NIGHT (1963)

               Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But, I'd go and visit her every chance 
                         I got.

               A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest, 
               holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people 
               inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny 
               is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the 
               passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable.

                                     JENNY
                         Ouch! That hurts.

               Forrest gets up and runs toward the car. He tries to look in 
               the window as he steps over to the driver's side door. He 
               opens the door and begins to punch the boy inside. Jenny 
               jump out of the car and runs over to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it!
                         Stop it!

                                     BILLY
                         Jesus!

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

                                     FORREST
                         He was hurtin' you.

               Jenny's date, named BILLY, gets out of the car angrily.

                                     BILLY
                         What the hell is going on here?

                                     JENNY
                         No, he's not!

                                     BILLY
                         Who is that? Who is that?

                                     JENNY
                         Get over there!

               Jenny turns and looks at Billy. He shoves Jenny's hands away 
               from him.

                                     JENNY
                         Billy, I'm sorry.

                                     BILLY
                         What in the hell, git, would you git 
                         away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't... Wait a second!

                                     BILLY
                         Git, just git away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't go! Billy, wait a second!

               Billy gets back into the car.

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't know any better!

               Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, why'd you do that?

               Forrest holds out the box of chocolates.

                                     FORREST
                         I brought you some chocolates. I'm 
                         sorry. I'll go back to my college 
                         now.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come 
                         on.

               Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM/HALLWAY

               Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Is this your room?

                                     JENNY
                         Shh!

               Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM ROOM

               Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny 
               hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed.

                                     JENNY
                         Do you ever dream, Forrest, about 
                         who you're gonna be?

                                     FORREST
                         Who I'm gonna be?

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah.

                                     FORREST
                         Aren't I going to be me?

                                     JENNY
                         Well, you'll always be you, just 
                         another kind of you. You know? I 
                         want to be famous.

               Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny 
               dries the water from her hair.

                                     JENNY
                         I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
                         I just want to be an empty stage 
                         with my guitar, my voice... just me.

               Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him.

               She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at 
               Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.

                                     JENNY
                         And I want to reach people on a 
                         personal level. I want to be able to 
                         say things, just one-to-one.

               Forrest looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that 
               he is looking at her.

                                     JENNY
                         Have you ever been with a girl, 
                         Forrest?

                                     FORREST
                         I sit next to them in my home 
                         economics class all the time.

                         You're listening to WHHY in 
                         Birmingham, the clear A.M. voice of 
                         Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...

               Forrest looks at Jenny as she removes her bra. Forrest looks 
               away, a bit shamed. Jenny takes his hand and guides it up to 
               her breast.

                                     DJ

                         anything but clear. The weatherman 
                         says that rain's gonna fall all night 
                         long so stay with us, get warm, get 
                         cozy, get under the covers to the 
                         cool sounds of WHHY.

               Forrest looks over at Jenny's breasts, the shudder as he has 
               an orgasm.

                                     FORREST
                         Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay.

               Forrest breathes heavily. Jenny puts her bra back on.

                                     JENNY
                         It's all right.

               Jenny leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder.

                                     DJ

                         It's okay.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, I'm dizzy.

               A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         I bet that never happened in home 
                         ec.

                         No.

               Jenny laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and 
               Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be 
               asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.

                                     FORREST
                         I think I ruined your roommate's

                                     JENNY
                         I don't care. I don't like her, 
                         anyway.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA/FOOTBALL STADIUM - DAY (1963)

               Forrest runs across the field as the defending team chases 
               him. The crowd yells for Forrest. They flip a sign that reads: 
               "Go Forrest."

                                     CROWD
                         Run! Run! Run!

               Forrest runs along the field. The crowd cheers.

                                     CROWD
                         Run! Run! Run!

               Forrest runs into the end zone. The band members rush toward 
               Forrest with their hands up, signaling him to stop. The crowd 
               flips over cards, creating a sign that reads "STOP."

                                     CROWD
                         Stop!

               Forrest stops in the end zone as he hears the crowd yells.

               The band motions for Forrest to stop and stay in the end

               zone. A group of defending players fall over each other in 
               the end zone. Forrest looks as the crowd cheers wildly.

               PRESIDENT KENNEDY holds an autographed football as the All- 
               American Team stands behind him. Forrest is among the players 
               in suits.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (over newsreel)
                         President Kennedy met with the 
                         Collegiate All-American Football 
                         Team at the Oval Office today.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY (1963)

               The All-American players mingle around the food table. Forrest 
               steps up to the table. A large spread of food and soda is on 
               the table.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, the real good thing about meeting 
                         the President of the United States 
                         is the food.

               Forrest takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet table.

               Numerous bottle of Dr. Pepper are displayed on the table. A 
               servant opens the bottle for him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         They put you in this little room 
                         with just about anything you'd want 
                         to eat or drink. And since number 
                         one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...

               Forrest begins to guzzle the Dr. Pepper.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and number two, they was free, I 
                         musta drank me about fifteen Dr. 
                         Peppers.

               Forrest sets down an empty Dr. Pepper bottle next to a large 
               number of other empty bottles. Forrest holds his stomach and 
               burps.

               BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE - President Kennedy shakes hands 
               with the All-American football players.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How does it feel to 
                         be an All-American?

                                     1ST PLAYER
                         It's an honor, Sir.

               Another player steps up to the President and shakes the 
               President's hand.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How does it feel to

                         Very good, Sir.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How does it feel to

                         Very good, Sir.

               The player walks away. Forrest steps up to the President.

               The President shakes his hand.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How do you feel?

                         I gotta pee.

               President Kennedy turns and smiles.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         I believe he said he had to go pee.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE/BATHROOM

               Forrest urinates in the bathroom, then lowers the lid and 
               flashes. Forrest washes his hands, then notices an autographed 
               photo from Marilyn Monroe and a photo of John with his brother 
               Bobby.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometime later, for no particular 
                         reason, somebody shot that nice young 
                         President when he was ridin' in his 
                         car.

               ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - Robert Kennedy stands at a podium as people 
               around him applaud.

                         ...somebody shot his little brother,

               EXT. SAVANNHA/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest sits on the bench and shakes his head.

                                     FORREST
                         It must be hard being brothers. I 
                         wouldn't know.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA - DAY - GRADUATION DAY (1966)

               Students in their caps and gowns step forward the podium to 
               receive their diplomas. Forrest's name is called. He steps 
               up and accepts his diploma.

                                     DEAN
                         Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now can you believe it? After only 
                         five years of playing football, I 
                         got a college degree.

               The dean shakes Forrest's hand vigorously. Forrest looks out 
               into the crowd.

                                     DEAN
                         Congratulations, son.

               Mrs. Gump, sitting in the audience, cries.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma was proud.

               Forrest and Mrs. Gump have their picure taken in front of a 
               large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest and steps 
               up to him.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here, 
                         I'll hold this for you.

               Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest. The recruiter slaps 
               Forrest on the shoulder and hands him some military 
               literature.

                                     MILITARY RECRUITER
                         Congratulations, son. Have you given 
                         any thought to your future?

                         Thought?

               Forrest looks at a pamphlet with a photo of "Uncle Sam" and 
               the caption "EXCELLENT CAREERS FOR EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN. Apply 
               now at your local U.S. Army Recruiting Center."

                         Hello, I'm Forrest...

               INT. ARMY BUS - DAY (1966)

               Forrest steps onto the army bus. Rain pours outside as the 
               army bus driver yells at Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         ...Forrest Gump.

                         Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you 
                         are, fuzzball! You're not even a 
                         lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get 
                         your faggoty ass on the bus. You're 
                         in the Army now!

               Forrest is about to sit on the first available seat, but the 
               recruit sitting there refuses Forrest.

                                     RECRUIT #1
                         This seat's taken.

               Forrest tries to sit on the next seat, but the 2nd recruit 
               slides over, blocking him.

                                     RECRUIT #2
                         It's taken.

               Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first 
               bus ride to school years ago.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         At first, it seemed like I made a 
                         mistake.

               A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much 
               like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. His name is BUBBA.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...seeing how it was my induction 
                         day and I was already gettin' yelled 
                         at.

               Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit 
               down.

                                     BUBBA
                         You can sit down... if you want to.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I didn't know who I might meet or 
                         what they might ask.

               Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief.

                                     BUBBA
                         You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

                         I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin' 
                         boat. I've been workin' on shrimp 
                         boats all my life. I started out my 
                         uncle's boat, that's my mother's 
                         brother, when I was about maybe nine.
                         I was just lookin' into buyin' a 
                         boat of my own and got drafted. My 
                         given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.

               Bubba and Forrest shake hands.

                                     BUBBA
                         People call me Bubba. Just like one 
                         of them redneck boys. Can you believe

               INT. LOUISIANA/KITCHEN - DAY (1966)

               Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries

               A DRILL SERGEANT is in Forrest's face as Forrest stands in

                         your bed real neat and remember to 
                         stand up straight.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         That is one very intelligent 
                         individual! You lock your scuzzy 
                         bodies up behind that private and do 
                         exactly what he does and you will go 
                         far in this man's army!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And always answer every question 
                         with "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Is that clear?

                                     FORREST & RECRUITS
                         Yes, Drill Sergeant!

               ANOTHER DAY

               The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling 
               their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest.

                                     BUBBA
                         What you do is you just drag your 
                         nets across the bottom. On a good 
                         day, you can catch over a hundred 
                         pounds of shrimp. If everything goes 
                         all right, two men shrimpin' ten 
                         hours, less what you spends on gas, 
                         you can...

               Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits 
               are still working on theirs.

                                     FORREST
                         Done, Drill Sergeant!

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Gump!

               The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Why did you put that weapon together 
                         so quickly, Gump?

                                     FORREST
                         You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

               The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Jesus Christ! This is a new company 
                         record. If it wouldn't be a waste of 
                         such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd 
                         recommended you for O.C.S., Private 
                         Gump. You are gonna be a General 
                         some day, Gump! Now, disassemble 
                         your weapon and continue!

               The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble 
               his rifle. After the Drill Sergeant walks past Bubba, Bubba 
               looks up at Forrest. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in 
               his slow southern drawl.

                                     BUBBA
                         Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is 
                         the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue 
                         it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute 
                         it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp 
                         creole...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest shine their boots.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried, 
                         stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp, 
                         lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper 
                         shrimp...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub 
               the floor with toothbrushes.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp 
                         salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp 
                         burger, shrimp sandwich... that's, 
                         that's about it.

               NIGHT

               Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Nighttime in the Army is a lovely 
                         time.

               Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd 
                         miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.

               A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest.

                                     YOUNG PRIVATE
                         Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on 
                         her!

               Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing 
               Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all.

               The pictorial is titled: "Girls of the South." Forrest looks 
               up with shock. He cranes his head up for a closer look.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Turns out, Jenny had gotten into 
                         some trouble over... some photos of 
                         her in her college sweater. And she 
                         was thrown out of school.
